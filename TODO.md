### Phase 8: API Development
- [ ] Create dashboard metrics API endpoints
- [ ] Implement disease case management APIs
- [ ] Add water quality data APIs
- [ ] Create alert management APIs
- [ ] Implement user management APIs
- [ ] Add data export APIs

### Phase 9: Data Integration & Mock Data
- [ ] Create comprehensive mock data sets
